The SAM/BAM/CRAM format is a way to store efficiently large numbers
of alignments, such as those routinely are created by next-generation
sequencing methods.

This module provides a low-level wrapper around the htslib C-API as
using cython and a high-level API for convenient access to the data in
SAM/BAM formatted files. Also included is an interface to the samtools
command line utilities and the tabix C-API for reading compressed and
indexed tabular data.

The current version wraps htslib-1.2.1 and samtools-1.2.
